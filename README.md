Prolog inplementations of the solutions to the Sunday Telegraph's "Safe Cracker" puzzle, along with a small library of helpers for stuff that comes up most weeks.

Disclaimer: I only buy the thing for the puzzles. Hopefully some of them (Enigmatic Variations springs to mind) can be saved when the ST inevitably goes out of business.
