Prolog implementations of the solutions to some of the logic puzzles in the weekend papers.

Includes the Sunday Telegraph's "Safe Cracker" puzzle and the i's "Brain Teaser", along with a small library of helpers for stuff that comes up most weeks.

Disclaimer: I only buy the ST for the puzzles. Hopefully some of them (Enigmatic Variations springs to mind) can be saved when it inevitably goes out of business.
